# Emotions in Music: A Comparative Sentiment Analysis of Popular Songs Across Countries and Markets

## Overview
This project seeks to explore how sentiments expressed in popular music lyrics vary between countries and markets. By applying sentiment analysis to the lyrics of top-charted songs from different regions, we aim to identify patterns in emotional tone that may reflect each country's cultural, social, and economic circumstances. The study will also assess how effective sentiment analysis is when applied to song lyrics, offering insights into its applications beyond traditional fields like social media monitoring and market research.

## Research Goals
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Develop and apply a sentiment analysis model tailored for song lyrics.
- **Country Comparison:** Compare the sentiment of songs from 10-20 different countries, based on their top charts.
- **Cultural Insights:** Analyze how external factors (e.g., political unrest, economic conditions) influence the emotional tone of popular music.
- **Validation:** Test hypotheses related to how sentiment in song lyrics correlates with national contexts.

## Methods
1. **Data Collection:** 
   - Extract top-charting songs from various countries using Spotify's API.
   - Scrape song lyrics from databases like Genius and Musixmatch.
   
2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Use tools such as VADER and TextBlob to quantify the sentiment in the lyrics.
   - Compare sentiment scores across countries and genres.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Perform statistical analysis (ANOVA, t-tests) to identify significant differences in sentiment across different countries and regions.

## Hypotheses
1. Countries experiencing political unrest or economic difficulties will exhibit more negative sentiment in their top-charted songs.
2. National mainstream songs reflect the emotional state of the population, with trends in emotional tone over time.
3. Songs expressing stronger emotions will be more successful in national charts than those with neutral sentiments.

## Tasks and Timeline
- **Data Collection:** Scrape top-charted songs and lyrics (Sept 2024)
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Apply sentiment models to song data (Oct 2024)
- **Comparison:** Analyze and compare the results across countries (Nov 2024)
- **Report:** Final report and presentation (Dec 2024)
